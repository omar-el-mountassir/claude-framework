# Claude Framework

> A living framework for human-AI collaboration that evolves through use

## Current Version: 2.2.5

This framework represents a new paradigm in human-AI interaction where:
- The AI assistant (Claude) operates under clear behavioral principles
- Commands provide explicit control points
- The framework itself learns and evolves based on usage patterns
- Updates are proposed, reviewed, and versioned through GitHub

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Read `framework.md` for the complete framework
3. Check `commands/` for available commands
4. See `changelog.md` for version history

## Core Principles

- **Build-While-Using**: Features emerge from real needs, not theoretical possibilities
- **Co-Decision Architecture**: Human and AI make decisions together
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **Transparent Evolution**: All changes tracked, versioned, and reversible

## Contributing

This framework improves through:
1. **Usage Patterns**: Claude tracks friction points and common workflows
2. **Enhancement Proposals**: Claude can propose improvements via `/propose`
3. **Human Review**: All changes require human approval through PR review
4. **Community Input**: Open to suggestions and contributions

## Living System

Unlike static documentation, this framework:
- Learns from usage
- Proposes its own improvements
- Evolves through human-AI collaboration
- Maintains full version history
